# Nth-Dimensional Evolutionary Automata
This is a Ruby2d implementation for my Nth-Dimensional Evolutionary Automata program! It's a cellular automata simulation a la Conway's Epic Game of Life except it uses an evolutionary algorithm and it looks like some sort of freaky gravity!

P.S. If "Nth-Dimensional Evolutionary Automata" is too much of a mouthful then you can just say NDEA (pronounced *en-dee-uh*)

### Run
This program uses the Ruby2D gem. To run the program, simply `cd` into the directory and run the engine script
```
cd automata
ruby engine.rb
```
